# Homework 4

* Detect face landmark
* Draw it on screen using another canvas (effect canvas)
* Locate your inner upper and lower lips
* Calculate the Euclidean distance
* Then play music simulate your singing

**NOTE**: I didn't do any normalization by face size, only heuristic threshold, so if no sound playing, just try to open your mouth as wide as possible
